Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project

This repository hosts a series of Python projects covering various techniques and methods in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Each folder focuses on a specific NLP topic and provides practical implementations.

Project Structure

The project includes modules covering the following main topics:

1-Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.

2-Basic Statistics and Bayesian Models: Basic statistical analysis and Bayesian models.

3-Language Models: Hidden Markov Models, Maximum Entropy Models, n-gram models.

4-Frequency-Based Methods: BoW, TF-IDF, n-gram models.

5-Word Embeddings: Word embedding techniques.

6-Sentiment Analysis: Sentiment analysis applications.

7-Clustering and Topic Modeling: Clustering and topic modeling techniques.

8-Contextual Meaning and Word Sense Disambiguation: Contextual meaning and word sense disambiguation.

9-Dependency Parsing: Dependency parsing.

Each folder contains detailed explanations and practical examples for the corresponding topic.

Requirements

To run the project, you will need the following Python libraries:

```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk spacy gensim tensorflow pytorch
```

Usage

Each module contains examples and explanations on how to implement the techniques. For example, the "1-Data Cleaning and Preprocessing" folder contains Python scripts demonstrating data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
